# Lobox technical assessment

Implement a multi drop-down select component with the ability to add new items by typing it in an input and pressing Enter. It should be closed by clicking outside of it.

Requirements:

- Use ReactJS

- Make the code reusable

- Use TypeScript

- Use SCSS, and try to implement it similarly to the image as much as possible.

You can find the design in the attachment.

Note: Please do not use chatGBT or pre-made code in Gitlab otherwise it will be waste of time for you and for us.
